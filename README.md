# Diplacusis Test

This is a simple implementation of a test for diplacusis. It varyies the frequency of a tone and 
asks the user to change the frequency of the tone to match the frequency of the test tone. 
The test is over after iterating over a range of frequencies and the results are written into a csv file.
